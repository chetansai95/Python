## 1. Difference between List and Tuple in Python?
| Feature     | List                       | Tuple             |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Mutability  | Mutable                    | Immutable         |
| Syntax      | `[]`                       | `()`              |
| Performance | Slower (due to mutability) | Faster            |
| Use Case    | Dynamic data               | Fixed/static data |
